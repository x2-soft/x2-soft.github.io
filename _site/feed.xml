&lt;h2 id=&quot;설치전-준비물&quot;&gt;설치전 준비물&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centos7 이미지 파일&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso&quot;&gt;CentOS7 다운로드&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iso 파일을 USB 메모리에 저장하기 위한 UTIL 설치&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/&quot;&gt;win32diskimager 다운로드&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/win32diskimager.png&quot; alt=&quot;설정&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;설치&quot;&gt;설치&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-centos-7-선택&quot;&gt;Install Centos 7 선택&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Install CentOS 7 선택&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;설치-과정에서-사용할-언어-선택&quot;&gt;설치 과정에서 사용할 언어 선택&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;언어 선택&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;소프트웨어-선택s&quot;&gt;소프트웨어 선택(S)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;소프트웨어 선택&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;기본환경-선택&quot;&gt;기본환경 선택&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;필요한 패키지들을 별도로 설치하기 위해 최소 설치를 선택합니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/5.png&quot; alt=&quot; 선택&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;설치대상-선택&quot;&gt;설치대상 선택&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;자동 파티션 설정을 선택합니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;설치대상선택&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;디스크-선택-및-파티션-설정&quot;&gt;디스크 선택 및 파티션 설정&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/7.png&quot; alt=&quot;디스크 선택 및 파티션 설정&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;파티션별 설정은 아래와 같이 진행하도록 하겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/boot - 500M ~ 1G&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swap - 메모리크기의 2배 정도&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/ - 20G&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/data - 남은 용량 모두 사용&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boot-파티션-생성&quot;&gt;/boot 파티션 생성&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swap-파티션-생성&quot;&gt;swap 파티션 생성&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-파티션-생성&quot;&gt;/ 파티션 생성&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;파티션을 생성하기에 앞서 장치 유형과 파일 시스템에 대해서 파악후 적절한 선택을 할 수 있도록 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lvm&quot;&gt;LVM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;논리적 스토리지를 생성하여 물리적 디스크 추가, 조정 등의 유연한 관리 및 확장에 용이&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;xfs&quot;&gt;xfs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;900만 TB 까지 지원이 가능(32비트는 16TB)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;마운트된 상태에서도 파일시스템 확장이 가능&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;포맷시간이 매우 빠름&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;파일시스템 체크시 매우 빠른 속도를 낼수 있음&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;대용량 위주의 파일시스템에 최적화되어 작은 사이즈의 파일에선 되려 속도 저하가 발생&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;파일 시스템 문제 발생시 커널 메시지가 나오지 않을 가능성이 존재&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;디버그 옵션이 없어 삭제된 파일은 복구 불가능&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;파일시스템 복구시 2TB 당 1GB 의 물리 메모리 필요&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;별도의 데몬에서 파일 시스템을 관리&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-파티션-생성&quot;&gt;/data 파티션 생성&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;별도의 home 파티션은 생성하지 않습니다. 상황에 따라 적절하게 생성해주시면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/15.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;변경-사항-저장&quot;&gt;변경 사항 저장&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;네트웍-관련-설정&quot;&gt;네트웍 관련 설정&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/18.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_images/20190704/20.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;설치-시작&quot;&gt;설치 시작&lt;/h2&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-formatting&quot;&gt;Special formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;strike through&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;==highlight==&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;*escaped characters*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-code-blocks&quot;&gt;Writing code blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt;. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-lists&quot;&gt;Reference lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick brown jumped over the lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-html&quot;&gt;Full HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jane</name></author><category term="summer" /><summary type="html">There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;

You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/code&gt; is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; files inform &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; and just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; uses the gems and versions as specified in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sal</name></author><summary type="html">gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems.

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education.

Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jane</name></author><category term="centos7" /><summary type="html">This is changed.
